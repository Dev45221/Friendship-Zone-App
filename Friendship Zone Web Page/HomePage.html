	<h2>Friendship</h2>
	<ul>Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people. It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an "acquaintance" or an "association", such as a classmate, neighbor, coworker, or colleague.</ul>
	<h2>For better friendships, be a better friend yourself</h2>
	<ul><b>Be the friend that you would like to have.</b> Treat your friend just as you want them to treat you. Be reliable, thoughtful, trustworthy, and willing to share yourself and your time.</ul>
	<ul><b>Be a good listener.</b> Be prepared to listen to and support friends just as you want them to listen to and support you.</ul>
	<ul><b>Don't set too many rules and expectations.</b>Instead, allow your friendship to evolve naturally. You’re both unique individuals so your friendship probably won’t develop exactly as you expect.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Be Forgiving.</b> No one is perfect and every friend will make mistakes. No friendship develops smoothly so when there’s a bump in the road, try to find a way to overcome the problem and move on. It will often deepen the bond between you.</ul>
